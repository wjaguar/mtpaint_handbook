<H1>7. Channels</H1>

<P>
mtPaint is able to create and use up to three utility channels - Alpha,
Selection and Mask. The Channels menu has various options which are used to
handle these features. At any time these channels will have the same geometry as
the image being edited. You can display the channels as overlays and prescribe
the colour and opacity of these overlays using the 'Configure Overlays' option.
</P>
<P>
You can edit any of the channels by selecting it from the menu and then using
the normal painting tools. The value of the pixels to be plotted is taken from
the 'Settings Toolbar'.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC1">7.1 Alpha</H2>

<P>
An image uses an alpha channel in order to determine how transparent a given
pixel is. Alpha channels can be used to smoothly blend the edges of one image
when super-imposing it onto another image, such as with layers. This is very
useful for things like text.
</P>
<P>
Alpha blending can either be done in a naive way, or with gamma correction if
enabled in the Preferences (see <A HREF="chap_06.html#SEC21">6.2.1</A>).
</P>
<P>
In the main editing window, a pixel that is made transparent by the alpha
channel will show the chequered pattern underneath like this:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/7.1.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
As you can draw in the alpha channel directly, mtPaint does not need an eraser
tool; to "erase" some part of image to transparent, you just draw with
transparency (alpha value 0) over it.
</P>
<P>
If you want to edit just the alpha channel it may be convenient to hide the
image channel or show the alpha channel as an overlay. These options can be
toggled on and off with the Channels menu. This is what the above image looks
like with these toggles switched on:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/7.1b.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
These options affect all layers at once, unless 'Enable overlays by layer' is
toggled on in the Preferences window; then, you can modify the appearance of just
some layers, leaving the rest displayed in the normal way.
</P>
<P>
If you disable alpha in the Channels menu, all pixels will display as fully
opaque, and processes which respect alpha transparency - such as image scaling,
rotating, skewing, or Gaussian blur - will ignore it.
</P>

<H3 ID="SEC11">7.1.1 Coupling RGBA Operations</H3>

<P>
When you have an alpha channel and you are painting to the image channel, it may
be convenient to couple painting actions between the image and alpha channels
(or to keep them separate). For example here are the results of painting a
rectangle with the 'Couple RGBA Operations' toggled on and off via the Channels
menu:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/7.1.1a.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/7.1.1b.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
Note: Gaussian Blur of an RGBA image affects both image and alpha channels when
this is on (respects alpha transparency when "Disable alpha" is off, or blurs
them separately when it is on).
</P>

<H3 ID="SEC12">7.1.2 Unassociate Alpha</H3>

<P>
RGB images with alpha transparency can be stored in two different ways. One way
is to store raw RGB values and alpha values as separate and independent
channels; this is called "unassociated alpha". Another way is to store RGB
values not raw, but premultiplied by corresponding alpha value, which is then
called "associated alpha". mtPaint, like most other image processing programs,
stores images with unassociated alpha, to be able to manipulate RGB and alpha
independently of one another, and not lose RGB data when zeroing out alpha. On
the other hand, rendering software prefers associated alpha, because with RGB
values already multiplied by alpha, less work remains to be done in real time
when doing alpha blending. Some image formats, such as TIFF and TGA, support
both types of alpha, but are frequently mislabelled; other formats such as PNG
or BMP support just one type of alpha, and usually don't define which - in
practice it means that it can be both types equally likely. mtPaint
automatically converts images with definitely recognized associated alpha to
unassociated - but type of alpha cannot be autodetected reliably, and when
autodetection fails, "Unassociate Alpha" allows one to convert a misdetected
image with associated alpha to unassociated.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC2">7.2 Selection</H2>

<P>
The selection channel is used by the copy function in order to include only
certain parts of the image. For example you may want to copy and paste an
elliptical shaped area like this:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/7.2.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
With selection channel, all the varied functions for creating, modifying, adding,
subtracting, etc., etc. of selections become simple, regular drawing operations.
You create an elliptical selection by filling an ellipse in the selection
channel; you feather a selection by applying a blur to the selection channel;
you shrink a selection by eroding, or grow it by dilating; invert it by - yes -
just inverting the channel; add to a selection by filling an additional selected
area, or just by drawing over the parts you want selected; or subtract from it by
filling/drawing with 0 (which is, conveniently, colour B by default). It is
because of this that mtPaint does not need any of these operations in the
Selection menu; all of them, and many more, are easily done with regular drawing
tools and effects.
</P>
<P>
Pasting feathered selections is affected by the "Use gamma correction when
painting" setting, see section <A HREF="chap_06.html#SEC21">6.2.1</A>.
</P>
<P>
In the section <A HREF="#SEC5">7.5</A> below, there are several examples of how you can use
the selection channel in various image editing tasks.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC3">7.3 Mask</H2>

<P>
The mask channel is used to protect certain areas of the image from being
changed by the painting tools. For example you can protect an elliptical shaped
area like this to avoid spraying pixels over it:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/7.3.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
The mask channel can also be used to selectively apply effects such as blur,
sharpen or any kind of colour transformation.
</P>
<P>
Normally each mask pixel is completely set or cleared (255 or 0), but partial
values in between can be used to offer semi protection (optionally with gamma
correction, see <A HREF="chap_06.html#SEC21">6.2.1</A>). See section <A HREF="#SEC58">7.5.8</A> for an
example of this.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC4">7.4 File Handling</H2>

<P>
If you are editing an image with any type of channel, mtPaint will save this
data within the PNG file format. Any other format except mtPaint's own
<A HREF="chap_A.html#SEC24">PMM</A> will not save this data except maybe the alpha channel
(see section <A HREF="chap_A.html#SEC2">A.2</A> for which formats do what when), so if
you need to keep the channel you will need to use the PNG or PMM format or save
the channel individually using the Channels menu.
</P>
<P>
Technically, in PNG the channel is saved as a compressed private chunk which
means that mtPaint will be able to recognise this data, but other image editors
will not.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC5">7.5 Tricks and Tips</H2>

<H3 ID="SEC51">7.5.1 Converting a Colour Transparency to an Alpha Transparency</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Create alpha channel using "Set colour A radius B", with A=B=transparent
colour
<LI>Invert the alpha channel
</UL>

<P>
This method fails for indexed palette images which contain another,
non-transparent palette colour with same RGB values as the transparent one. This
can be prevented by first changing transparent colour's RGB to something
otherwise unused.
</P>
<P>
Another method is to:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Mask the transparent colour (i.e. click to the right of the transparent colour
on the palette so that the 'x' appears).
<LI>Create a cleared alpha channel.
<LI>Edit the alpha channel and press Ctrl-A to select all.
<LI>Select an alpha of 255 on the settings toolbar.
<LI>Fill selection.
</UL>

<H3 ID="SEC52">7.5.2 Converting an Alpha Transparency to a Colour Transparency</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Create a mask channel from alpha and switch to editing it
<LI>Threshold it at value you want (128 for more-than-half transparent to become
transparent)
<LI>Switch to editing image
<LI>Set colour A to the transparent colour
<LI>Select all
<LI>Fill selection
</UL>

<H3 ID="SEC53">7.5.3 Separating a Red, Green or Blue Channel</H3>

<UL>

</UL>

<H3 ID="SEC54">7.5.4 Adding a Red, Green or Blue Channel</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Copy single-colour image into clipboard
<LI>Load the RGB image from somewhere
<LI>Set colour A to red, green or blue respectively
<LI>Toggle tint mode on and tint +- mode on

<LI>Fill selection
<LI>Toggle tint +- off
<LI>Paste
</UL>

<H3 ID="SEC55">7.5.5 Converting Red, Green or Blue into any Other Colour</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Create a selection channel from R, G or B
<LI>Fill image with the colour you want
<LI>Copy it to clipboard

<LI>Paste
</UL>

<H3 ID="SEC56">7.5.6 Adding or Subtracting Masks</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Copy one mask into clipboard
<LI>Load or create the other mask
<LI>Toggle tint mode on (For subtracting, just toggle on tint +- on)
<LI>Paste
</UL>

<H3 ID="SEC57">7.5.7 Creating a Mask from a Single Colour</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Pick the colour from the canvas using Ctrl+Left/Right mouse click to store it
in colour A &amp; B
<LI>Create a new channels using 'Set colour A radius B'
</UL>

<H3 ID="SEC58">7.5.8 Cutting out Text Shapes from a Photo</H3>

<P>
It is possible to cut out text shapes from a photo like this:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/7.5.8.jpg" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Load the photo into mtPaint
<LI>Create and edit a new empty selection channel
<LI>Paste some text onto the selection channel with anti-aliasing
<LI>Create a new mask channel based on the selection channel
<LI>Invert the mask channel
<LI>Edit the main image channel
<LI>Select the whole image and cut using Ctrl+A and Ctrl+X
<LI>Remove the mask and selection channels
<LI>Paste the clipboard onto the image
</UL>

<P>
This technique works with all images. For example you could use
it to cut out shapes from a gradient you have created.
</P>

<H3 ID="SEC59">7.5.9 Creating Text Cut Outs for Web Pages</H3>

<P>
It is possible to cut out text shapes from a photo and use them as web graphics
like this:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/7.5.9.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Load the photo into mtPaint
<LI>Create and edit a new alpha channel
<LI>Paste some text
<LI>Crop the image to the text
<LI>Save the image as an RGB PNG file, so it can be read by alpha PNG aware
browsers
</UL>

<H3 ID="SEC510">7.5.10 Feathered Edges</H3>

<P>
It is possible to use the Gaussian Blur effect to feather the edge of any
channel like this:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/7.5.10.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Load an image into mtPaint
<LI>Create a new selection channel
<LI>Use the selection tool to paint an ellipse
<LI>Use the Gaussian Blur effect with a value of 10
<LI>Edit the image channel
<LI>Select the area you want and paste it somewhere
</UL>

<P>
It is also possible to use a gradient to achieve other types of feathered edges
like this:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/7.5.10b.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>

<H3 ID="SEC511">7.5.11 Outlined Edges</H3>

<P>
It is possible to use an alpha channel to create outlines on an image like this:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/7.5.11a.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Load the original into mtPaint
<LI>Ctrl+A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl+Shift+V to create a new layer
<LI>Select the 'Effects-&gt;Edge Detect' menu option
<LI>Press the 'Insert' key and set saturation to a minimum and raise gamma to
about 300
<LI>Select 'Channels-&gt;Edit Alpha' menu option and create the alpha channel from
'Image Red'
<LI>Select 'Channels-&gt;Edit Image' menu option
<LI>Select 'Effects-&gt;Invert' and then 'Channels-&gt;Threshold' to the value of 230
<P></P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/7.5.11c.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
<P></P>
<LI>If you want to make the edges much sharper select 'Channels-&gt;Edit Alpha' and
'Channels-&gt;Threshold' to value 30
<P></P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/7.5.11b.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
<P></P>
<LI>Export the composite image using 'Layers-&gt;Save Composite Image ...'
<LI>If you want to keep the outline image and its alpha channel use 'File-&gt;Save as ...'
<LI>If you want to keep the layer data file use 'Layers-&gt;Save as ...'
</UL>

<H3 ID="SEC512">7.5.12 Partial Masking</H3>

<P>
It is possible to use partial masking to create image transition effects. For
example I created the following image by doing the following:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Create an image using a chequer pattern.
<LI>Create an empty mask channel.
<LI>Paint a gradient onto the mask channel.
<LI>Paste another image onto the image channel (in this case yellow zigzags).
</UL>

<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/7.5.12.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>

<H3 ID="SEC513">7.5.13 Magic Wand Selections</H3>

<P>
It is possible to emulate the Magic Wand tool that appears in other graphics
programs by using a selection channel and the flood fill tool. For example, here
is the start image:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/7.5.11b.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
In order to copy and paste the red star, you would do the following:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Create a clear new selection channel.
<LI>Right click on the flood fill icon and check the option 'By Image Channel'.
<LI>Select the flood fill tool and ensure that on the settings toolbar the
selection value is 255.
<LI>Left click on the red star.
<LI>Move back to editing the image channel.
<LI>Use the rectangle selection tool to place a square around the red star.
<LI>Press the lasso button and you should be able to move the selected red star
around ready for pasting like this:
</UL>

<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/7.5.13b.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
It is also possible to use this flood fill method several times before copying
and pasting in order to add several areas from the original image to the
selection. For example I could flood fill the blue and yellow shapes to achieve
this result:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/7.5.13c.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>

<H3 ID="SEC514">7.5.14 Colour Replacement</H3>

<P>
It is possible to replace one colour without touching others, when using any
drawing tool. In indexed mode, you can do that using colour mask:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Select "Palette-&gt;Mask All" menu option; "x" marks will appear beside all
colours in palette window.
<LI>Click on the "x" mark beside the colour you wish to replace, to unmask it.
<LI>Draw.
</UL>

<P>
In RGB mode, you can use the colour-selective mode:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Right click on the colour-selective mode icon on the settings toolbar, to
open the configuration dialog.
<LI>Set the "Centre" colour to the colour you wish to replace.
<LI>Select the "Cube" mode, check the "Inverse" option, and set radius to 0.
<LI>Press "OK" to close the dialog.
<LI>Left click on the colour-selective mode icon to activate the mode.
<LI>Draw.
</UL>

<P>
Alternately, you can use masking:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Choose the colour you wish to replace as colour A and colour B both.
<LI>Create a new mask channel as "Colour A radius B, inverted".
<LI>Draw.
</UL>
