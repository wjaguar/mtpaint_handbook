mtPaint is a simple GTK+1/2 painting program designed for creating icons and pixel based artwork. It can edit indexed palette or 24 bit RGB images and offers basic painting and palette manipulation tools. It also has several other more powerful features such as channels, layers and animation. Due to its simplicity and lack of dependencies it runs well on GNU/Linux, Windows and older PC hardware.<BR>
<BR>
There is full documentation of mtPaint's features contained in a handbook.  If you don't already have this, you can download it from the mtPaint website.<BR>
<BR>
If you like mtPaint and you want to keep up to date with new releases, or you want to give some feedback, then the mailing lists may be of interest to you:<BR>

Compilation<BR>
-----------<BR>
<BR>
In order to compile mtPaint on a GNU/Linux system you will need to have the libraries and headers for GTK+1 and/or GTK+2, libpng and zlib.  If you want to load or save GIF, JPEG and TIFF files you will also need libungif, libjpeg and libtiff.  If you want to compile the international version you will need to have the gettext system and headers installed.  You may then adjust the Makefile/sources to cater for your needs and then:<BR>
<BR>
For GTK+2<BR>
=========<BR>
<BR>
./configure<BR>
make<BR>
su -c "make install"<BR>
<BR>
For GTK+1<BR>
=========<BR>
<BR>
./configure gtk1<BR>
make<BR>
su -c "make install"<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If you want to uninstall these files from your system, you should type:<BR>
<BR>
su -c "make uninstall"<BR>
<BR>
There are various configure options that may be useful for some people.  Use "./configure --help" to find out what options are available.  If you are compiling a binary for distribution to other peoples systems, the option 'asneeded' is particularly useful (if the gcc option -Wl,--as-needed is available, i.e. binutils &gt;=2.17), as it only creates links to libraries which are absolutely necessary to mtPaint.  For example, without this option if you compile mtPaint against GTK+2.10 you will find it will not run on GTK+2.6 systems because Cairo doesn't exist on the older system.<BR>
<BR>
Use "./configure release" to compile mtPaint with the same optimizations we use for distribution packages; this includes the "asneeded" option. To enable internationalization, add the "intl" option.<BR>
<BR>
If you are compiling mtPaint on an older system without gtk-config, you may need to adjust the configure script so that the GTK+1 settings are done manually.  I have provided an example in the configure script to demonstrate.<BR>
<BR>
You can call mtpaint with the -v option and the program will start in viewer mode so there will be no palette, menu bar, etc.  You can restore these items by pressing the "Home" key.  After installation you can create a symlink to add a viewer command, e.g.<BR>
<BR>
su -c "ln -s mtpaint /usr/local/bin/mtv"<BR>
<BR>
Then you can open some graphics files with "mtv *.jpg".  This is a shortcut to writing "mtpaint -v *.jpg".  mtPaint can only edit one image at a time, but when you have more than one filename in the command line a window will appear with all of the filenames in a list.  If you select one of the names, it will be loaded.  I find this is helpful for editing several icons or digital photos.<BR>
<BR>
After running mtPaint for the first time, a new file is created to store your preferred settings and previously used files etc.  This file is named ".mtpaint" and stored in the user's home directory.  If you rename or remove this file then the next time mtPaint is run it will use the default settings.<BR>
<BR>
It is also possible to compile mtPaint on a Windows system using MinGW/MSYS with the relevant header and library files.  If you want to do this you must first download the normal setup program and install the files to "C:/Program Files/mtPaint/" and then:<BR>
<BR>
1) Install MinGW and MSYS - http://www.mingw.org/ <BR>
MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe - to c:/MinGW/<BR>
MSYS-1.0.10.exe - to c:/msys/<BR>
<BR>
2) Install the GTK+2 developer packages (and dependencies like libpng) - ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.6/win32/ and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html <BR>
<BR>
For GTK+2 you will need to download and extract the following zip files to c:/msys: <BR>
gtk+-dev-2.6.4.zip<BR>
pango-dev-1.8.0.zip<BR>
atk-dev-1.9.0.zip<BR>
<BR>
You will also need to download and extract the following zip files to c:/msys: <BR>
glib-dev-2.6.4.zip<BR>
libpng-1.2.7-lib.zip<BR>
zlib-1.2.1-1-lib.zip<BR>
libungif-4.1.4-lib.zip<BR>
jpeg-6b-3-lib.zip<BR>
tiff-3.6.1-2-lib.zip<BR>
<BR>
If you want to compile the internationlized version you will need to download and extract to c:/msys the following zip files from http://sourceforge.net/projects/gettext : <BR>
gettext-runtime-0.13.1.bin.woe32.zip<BR>
gettext-tools-0.13.1.bin.woe32.zip<BR>
libiconv-1.9.1.bin.woe32.zip<BR>
<BR>
For some reason I needed to move c:/msys/bin/msgfmt &amp; xgettext to c:/msys/local/bin/ in order to get it to run properly. If you have trouble running msgfmt you may need to do the same. <BR>
<BR>
3) Download the latest mtPaint sources and unpack them to c:/msys. <BR>
<BR>
4) To compile the code you must then use MSYS to "./configure", then "make" and "make install" <BR>
<BR>
5) If all goes well, you should have mtpaint.exe which you can run using the same method described above.  You may have compiled mtPaint using more recent versions of libraries so you may need to change the filenames, such as libpng12.dll -&gt; libpng13.dll and libungif.dll -&gt; libungif4.dll.<BR>
 <BR>
Because I very rarely use Windows, I am sadly unable to support GTK+1 or older versions of GTK+2 on this system anymore due to a lack of time.<BR>
