<H1>3. Pixel Art</H1>
<P>
Pixel Art is the main task that mtPaint is designed for. This art form is
essentially very simple and similar to painting in the real world. For example
you have a canvas to paint on, a brush to paint with, and a palette of colours
for the brush to use.
</P>
<P>
Here is what the mtPaint main window looks like:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
The toolbars at the top and the palette on the left can be toggled on and off
with the keys F5-F8 to best suit the job you are doing.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC1"></A>
<H2>3.1 Creating a New Canvas</H2>
<P>
The first decision you need to make before starting a project is what type of
canvas do you want to work with. mtPaint supports two types of canvas:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Indexed Palette
<LI>24 bit RGB
</UL>

<P>
Indexed Palette images use a palette of between 2 and 256 colours. Each of these
colours can be set by the user and is saved along with the canvas to the image
file. RGB images do not save the palette, but they have the benefit of being
able to use many millions of colours in the image. For any type of work related
to digital photographs you will need to use an RGB canvas.
</P>
<P>
When starting mtPaint you automatically have an empty canvas with the same
geometry as your previous work. If you want something else you must use the new
image window which is called up by pressing Ctrl-N, using the File menu or by
pressing the new image icon. It allows you to:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>create a new empty canvas (up to 16384 x 16384 pixels)
<LI>grab a screenshot of the current desktop
<LI>import image from the system clipboard (or from internal clipboard if the
system clipboard is empty)
</UL>

<P>
If you check the 'Undoable' option when creating new image, it becomes possible
to undo it just like any other editing operation. This is especially useful
when grabbing screenshots - you can grab several, and then save all of them at
once using 'Export undo images' from the File menu.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC2"></A>
<H2>3.2 Painting Tools</H2>
<P>
mtPaint has several different painting tools which you can use. To start using
these tools you select the relevant icon on the Tools section of the toolbar at
the top of the mtPaint window.
</P>
<P>
If at any time you make a mistake, you can always use the undo and redo
functions via the Ctrl-Z and Ctrl-R keys, the Edit menu or the main toolbar.
By default, you can undo up to 100 actions - less if undo space is not large
enough. Preferences window allows you to allocate more memory to the undo
space, or increase the undo limit up to 1000 actions.
</P>
<P>
Generally, you need undo space of at least twice the uncompressed size of the
largest image you want to process - i.e., (width x height x 6) for RGB images,
or (width x height x 2) for indexed.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC21"></A>
<H3>3.2.1 Paint</H3>
<P>
The Paint tool is the simplest painting tool. The easiest way to use it is to
select one of the pre-defined brush settings by pressing F3 or by clicking on
the brush preview area above the palette. This will then give you a selection
of brush shapes to choose from:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.2.1b.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
If you want to manually adjust the brush size, or flow of the spray, you can do
this by using the settings toolbar.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC22"></A>
<H3>3.2.2 Shuffle</H3>
<P>
The shuffle tool swaps random pixels in the brush area. It is useful for mixing
between two blocks of colour on the canvas and creating a pixellated texture
like this:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.2.2.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
The tool size and flow affect how the shuffle operates on the canvas.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC23"></A>
<H3>3.2.3 Flood Fill</H3>
<P>
The flood fill works by filling an area where all of the pixels are the same
colour. If you right click on the flood fill icon you can have more control over
the flood fill actions.
</P>
<P>
By setting 'By image channel' you can fill an area on a utility channel by using
the image channel as the reference for the fill area.
</P>
<P>
A 'fuzzy' mode can be used by setting the number to greater than 0. This mode
allows you to fill an area of pixels that are similar to the one you first
click, rather than relying on pixels being identical, which is useful for
photographs.
</P>
<P>
The 'RGB Cube' toggle makes the fuzzy mode use the RGB cube model as opposed to
the default L*X*N* sphere, which can be useful for certain situations (see
<A HREF="#SEC54">3.5.4</A> for more details of the difference between the cube and sphere
methods). The 'Gradient-driven' toggle makes the fuzzy mode consider the
difference between adjacent pixels, rather than the original starting pixel and
each candidate pixel.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC24"></A>
<H3>3.2.4 Straight Line</H3>
<P>
To draw a straight line in mtPaint you simply:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Select the straight line tool from the toolbar
<LI>Left click and release where you want the line to start
<LI>Move the pointer to where you want the line to end and left click
</UL>

<P>
The line procedure will then continue until you press the right mouse button or
press the Escape key to stop. The thickness of this line is set by the tool
size.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC241"></A>
<H4>3.2.4.1 Drawing Arrows</H4>
<P>
The straight line tool can also draw an arrow head at the end of the current
line if you press either the 'A' or 'S' keys for an open or closed head. The
size of the head is determined by the tool flow.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC25"></A>
<H3>3.2.5 Smudge</H3>
<P>
The smudge tool is only available when you are editing an RGB image. It works by
smudging an area of pixels set by the tool size. By dragging the mouse in
different directions you will achieve a different smudge effect. Here is an
example of smudging:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.2.5.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
This effect is achieved with Continuous mode switched on and Opacity mode
switched off.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC26"></A>
<H3>3.2.6 Clone</H3>
<P>
The clone tool is used to copy chunks from one part of the image to the other.
After selecting the clone tool you must set the tool size and then move the
mouse cursor over the canvas area. Then you hold the Ctrl key down and move the
mouse in order to position the tool perimeter (black and white) away from the
clone perimeter (black and red). After releasing Ctrl you can then press the
left mouse button to copy pixels from the red and black box to the white and
black box. Here is an example:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.2.6.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<A NAME="SEC27"></A>
<H3>3.2.7 Text</H3>
<P>
If you wish to paste some text onto the canvas you need to press the 'T' key or
click the text tool icon on the toolbar. You will then be presented with a form,
where you need to type in the text you want to paste onto the canvas. You will
be able to change the font type and its size.
</P>
<P>
If you are using GTK+2 and editing an RGB image you also have the option of
having antialiased text for smoother edges. GTK+2.6 users have the luxury of
rotating the text to any angle.
</P>
<P>
Once you are happy with the text in the preview area you will then be able to
drag the text around and position it where you want. You can then change the
colour of the text by clicking on a palette colour or you may want to change the
pattern. You can rotate the text by 90 degree steps at any time with with the
rotate selection icons on the toolbar, or by using the Selection menu. You
commit the text to the canvas just like you would for a normal paste operation,
so you right click or press the Enter key.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC271"></A>
<H4>3.2.7.1 Text (FreeType)</H4>
<P>
As well as using the standard GTK+ text rendering facilities, mtPaint can also
use the FreeType text rendering library directly in order to gain the following
advantages:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Bitmap fonts can be used, including scaling and rotating.
<LI>Fonts are loaded directly from files, so do not need to be installed on the
host operating system.
<LI>Scalable fonts without italic or oblique styles can be skewed in order to
achieve an oblique effect.
<LI>Rendering is identical regardless of operating system, or GTK+ version.
<LI>Rendering and rotation quality is higher on some systems, such as Windows.
<LI>Text rotation is available to GTK+1 and GTK+2.0 - GTK+2.4 systems.
<LI>The GTK+1 version of mtPaint can now paste anti-aliased text.
</UL>

<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.2.7.1.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
Despite these advantages, the standard GTK+ text rendering is still retained in
mtPaint as it has these advantages:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Some systems may offer font substitution facilities which makes using
different alphabets within a single string possible.
<LI>It is a simpler dialog which some people may prefer if they don't need the
extra power and quality that the FreeType rendering offers.
</UL>

<P>
The first step when using the FreeType text tool is to populate the 'Font
Directory' tab. When the dialog is started for the first time, mtPaint will
attempt to find all the fonts on your system automatically. If this fails then
you will need to manually enter each directory which contains the fonts that you
want to use. Once you are happy with your directories you must press the 'Create
Index' button which will create the font index.
</P>
<P>
At this point you should be able to return to the 'Text' tab and select the font
you wish to use.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC3"></A>
<H2>3.3 The Palette</H2>
<P>
The palette is positioned on the left hand side of the mtPaint window and is
used to select colours for painting. If you left click on a colour it is chosen
for colour A and a right click will choose colour B. Colour A and B are
previewed in a small area above the palette. A and B can be swapped by pressing
the 'X' key.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC31"></A>
<H3>3.3.1 Editing the Palette</H3>
<P>
You can edit colours A and B by pressing Ctrl-E, or by clicking on the colours
A/B preview.
</P>
<P>
In case the image is indexed, and colours A and B are the same, you need to
edit colour B to get the palette entry to change.
</P>
<P>
You can edit the whole palette by pressing Ctrl-W, or by clicking on colour
index in the palette window - in this case palette editor starts with the
clicked colour selected.
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.3.1.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
When editing the whole palette, you can create colour scales between two
selected colours; set the "From" and "To" spins to the endpoints of the scale,
select the interpolation mode, and press the "Create" button. Pressing the
"From" and "To" buttons sets the corresponding spin to the current colour index.
</P>
<P>
Scales can be built by interpolating between the endpoints' colours in RGB, in
HSV, or by using the currently selected gradient; in the latter case, the
endpoints get modified too. If you want a reverse HSV or gradient scale, set
the endpoints in a reverse order (the "To" index smaller than the "From" index).
</P>
<A NAME="SEC32"></A>
<H3>3.3.2 Loading and Saving the Palette</H3>
<P>
You can save and load the current palette by accessing the relevant function in
the Palette menu. If you want a palette file to be used as the default mtPaint
palette you can set this in the Path section of the Preferences window.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC33"></A>
<H3>3.3.3 Sorting and Adjusting the Palette</H3>
<P>
It is possible to sort the whole palette by using the Palette menu option. You
can move a single palette entry from one index to another by doing the
following:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Move the mouse pointer to the colour you want to move
<LI>Press and hold the shift key
<LI>Press and hold the left mouse button
<LI>Drag the pointer to the desired index
<LI>Release the mouse pointer to commit the operation
</UL>

<P>
When doing this with an indexed image, the canvas colours will be adjusted to
accommodate the change.
</P>
<P>
The general colour of the palette can be adjusted when editing an RGB image by
pressing the 'Insert' key and adjusting the settings with the palette toggle
set.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC34"></A>
<H3>3.3.4 Colour Protection</H3>
<P>
There is a colour protection mask feature which stops certain colours from being
painted over on the canvas. This is very useful when you have drawn an outline
and then want to fill in between these lines with other colours without
affecting the outline. To protect a colour from being painted on, simply left
click to the right of its colour in the palette window - a cross should then
appear. Click again and the mask will be removed and this colour can be edited
on the canvas as normal. The palette menu allows you to set or clear the mask
for all colours. This protection affects all basic tools like normal painting or
pasting (RGB &amp; Indexed images) and also global functions like effects and colour
transformations.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC35"></A>
<H3>3.3.5 The Transparent Colour</H3>
<P>
When editing certain types of file like XPM, GIF or PNG you may wish to have a
particular colour set as transparent. To do this you press Ctrl-P for the
Preferences window and then go to the Files section and set the palette index
you want to be transparent. A setting of -1 will turn transparency off. You also
have an opportunity to set this when using the 'Save As' option.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC36"></A>
<H3>3.3.6 Picking a Colour from the Canvas</H3>
<P>
While you are painting it is sometimes useful to select a colour from the canvas
for colour A or B. To do this you hold down the Ctrl key and press the left
mouse button to choose colour A or the right button for colour B.
</P>
<P>
Ctrl+double click will select the gamma corrected average colour under the
selection rectangle, or if there is no selection, under the brush square.
Again, double clicking the left button selects colour A, and right button,
colour B. You can use this to select colours for antialiasing.
</P>
<P>
If you picked an RGB colour from canvas, and want to find one like it in your
palette, you can do it by Ctrl+middle click. This will change colour A to the
palette colour nearest to it, and choose colour B and pattern to together
produce the best possible approximation of the original colour A. If you do not
need the dither, but only the nearest solid colour, then Ctrl+middle click a
second time - this will set colour B to same as colour A, and pattern to solid.
</P>
<P>
While you are editing the whole palette, you can select any colour from anywhere
on your computer screen by pressing the eye dropper icon.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC37"></A>
<H3>3.3.7 Copy to Palette</H3>
<P>
If you are editing an RGB or indexed image the Edit menu allows you to copy the
current selection, or clipboard contents if there is no selection, to the
palette. This operation also sets the size of the palette accordingly.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC38"></A>
<H3>3.3.8 Paste Palette</H3>
<P>
If you are editing an RGB image the Edit menu allows you to put the current
palette onto clipboard, which you could then paste to the canvas. If you
firstly select an area with the selection tool you can make the paste area have
a different width.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC4"></A>
<H2>3.4 Patterns</H2>
<P>
Painting actions normally use a flat colour, but it is possible to use different
patterns. To choose a different pattern you can press F2 or click on the pattern
preview area just above the palette. You will then be presented with the
following patterns which you can choose from:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.4.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="chap_A.html#SEC61">Section A.6.1</A> explains how to customize these patterns.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC5"></A>
<H2>3.5 Painting Modes</H2>
<P>
Painting modes can be used to change the general behaviour of the painting
actions. These modes are toggled on and off by using the settings toolbar icons,
as shown here:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.5.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
Not all modes are applicable to all of the tools. Here is a table detailing
which modes affect each of the tools:
</P>

<P>
Paint includes brushes, sprays, straight lines, selection shape fills and
outlines.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC51"></A>
<H3>3.5.1 Continuous</H3>
<P>
If continuous mode is set then when you drag the mouse over the canvas and paint
as well, the gaps between the movements are filled in. If you use non-continuous
mode you can right click on the mode icon and set the brush spacing between tool
commits. A value of 0 means that spacing is disabled and a tool is committed
every time it is reported to mtPaint. Here is an example of what can be
achieved:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.5.1.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
The first line was created using continuous mode. The second line was created
using non-continuous mode with a brush space of 0, and the final line was
created with a brush space of 5. Varying the non-continuous brush spacing also
makes the results of using the spray tool more deterministic, however fast the
mouse is moved.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC52"></A>
<H3>3.5.2 Opacity</H3>
<P>
When you are painting with an opacity of less than 255, and the opacity undo
mode is switched on then the paint operation will change each pixel according to
this value in a single uniform way, like this example:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.5.2a.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
If opacity mode is switched off then the opacity will be increased each time the
tool paints over a pixel, like this example:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.5.2b.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<A NAME="SEC53"></A>
<H3>3.5.3 Tint</H3>
<P>
If the tint mode is switched on while editing an RGB image then instead of
replacing the whole colour, the operation will increase or decrease the
individual colour channel relative to colour A and B. With an indexed image, it
will be the index that is increased or decreased. For painting operations
pressing the left button will increase, and the right button will decrease. For
selection based filling operations you will also need to set the Tint +- toggle
to determine which direction the tinting will occur. Here is an example of
tinting with blue ellipses over a greyscale image:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.5.3.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<A NAME="SEC54"></A>
<H3>3.5.4 Colour Selection</H3>
<P>
Colour selection mode is a special kind of mask that regulates painting
operations according to the colour of the pixels on the canvas. You configure
the mode settings by right clicking on the toggle button which brings up the
following dialog:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.5.4.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
The screenshot depicts a smooth grey gradient from one corner to the other, and
the colour selection is for a middle section of this grey. The green preview
area indicates what pixels will be protected from painting operations. By
selecting the 'Inverse' toggle you will be designating which pixels will be
available for painting.
</P>
<P>
The sphere option is the L*X*N* Sphere (the same as fuzzy flood fills) and uses
Euclidean distance in a perceptionally uniform colour space, thus it better
conforms to human colour vision. However, it uses expensive calculations and
using it could cause delays. The Cube option uses the largest of differences
between Red, Green and Blue colour components, so it is faster but less
discriminating, and could best be used for, say, same-coloured areas while
ignoring noise in RGB colours' low bits, or when filling areas so large that
default mode becomes too slow.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC55"></A>
<H3>3.5.5 Mask</H3>
<P>
The disable all masks toggle is used to temporarily disable the current masks.
This affects the mask channel, any colours in the palette that have been
protected and also the colour-selection mask.
</P>
<A NAME="SEC56"></A>
<H3>3.5.6 Gradient</H3>
<P>
When you select the gradient mode by clicking the horizontal gradient button,
you are able to paint smooth graduated areas of pixels onto the canvas. By
default the gradient uses colour A and B, although you can define your own
colours, which is explained later. Once the mode is switched on, there are two
ways to use it:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>As a placed gradient in a fixed position using the gradient selection tool
followed by a painting tool.
<LI>As a stroke gradient using the brush shapes.
</UL>

<A NAME="SEC561"></A>
<H4>3.5.6.1 Placed Gradients</H4>
<P>
You place a gradient by selecting the gradient placement tool from the toolbar
and then you place the beginning and end points by clicking the mouse. Once this
has been done you will see a temporary preview of the resulting gradient and you
then need to select a painting tool and paint on the canvas. In order to
configure the gradient you need to press the right button on the gradient
placement icon on the toolbar. Here is an example of a simple linear gradient
from red to yellow painted using the polygon tool to create a triangle. The
image on the left displays the construction lines for the gradient placement
tool and the polygon tool, whereas the image on the right represents the exact
pixels on the canvas:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.5.6.1a.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
By using several of the settings on the gradient configuration dialog you can
achieve all sorts of creative effects. For example, here is a rainbow which I
painted:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.5.6.1b.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
This image was created using the following steps from a new mtPaint session:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Create a new RGB image.
<LI>Select red as colour A (index 1) and magenta as colour B (index 5).
<LI>Use the gradient placement tool to place both points near the bottom centre of
the image.
<LI>Right click on the gradient placement icon to configure the following:
  <UL>
  <LI>Length of 75 - The full width of the rainbow.
  <LI>Offset of 50 - Creates the hole in the middle.
  <LI>Radial gradient type.
  <LI>Use Gradient 'A to B (HSV)' using the reverse toggle - This creates the
full sweep of the colour spectrum.
  </UL>
<LI>Use the settings toolbar to switch on gradient mode.
<LI>Select the rectangle selection tool and paint the top half of the rainbow
using the icon to 'Fill Selection'.
</UL>

<A NAME="SEC562"></A>
<H4>3.5.6.2 Stroke Gradients</H4>
<P>
To make stroke gradients work you must firstly clear any gradient line that you
have positioned on the canvas by pressing escape or the right mouse button with
the gradient placement tool on. Then you must set up the stroke by pressing the
right button on the gradient placement icon on the toolbar. As an example for
what you can achieve, the following was created using a red to white gradient
with a length of 50 and an extension type of 'Mirror':
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.5.6.2a.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
Here is an example using similar settings, but with the extension type 'None'
and a smaller brush:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.5.6.2b.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<A NAME="SEC563"></A>
<H4>3.5.6.3 Custom Gradients</H4>
<P>
If you want to create a gradient or opacity composed from more than just end
points then you will need to select the 'Custom' gradient type, and then press
the 'Edit Custom' button. You can then define up to 256 points on the gradient
which will then be placed equal distances apart. Here is an example of a simple
custom gradient:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.5.6.3.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
Here are the steps I took to create this image:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Create a new image.
<LI>Configure the gradient to be a 'Radial' type, and to have a 'Repeat' extension
type.
<LI>Select 'Custom' for the Gradient and then press the 'Edit Custom' button.
<LI>Select 5 colours, each defined as 'Constant' so that only block colours are
used.
<LI>Use the gradient placement tool to place the first point at the centre
of the image and the second point some distance away from the centre and image
edges.
<LI>Press Ctrl-A to select the whole image and then press the 'Fill Selection'
icon to fill the whole image with the gradient.
</UL>

<A NAME="SEC564"></A>
<H4>3.5.6.4 Utility Channel Gradients</H4>
<P>
It is possible to paint gradients on utility channels using the same methods as
painting on the image channel. For example, here is the above image with a
gradient painted onto the alpha channel:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.5.6.4.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
Here are the steps I took to create this image:
</P>

<LI>Select 'Edit Alpha' from the Channels menu and 'Set' all of the pixels.
<LI>Use the gradient placement tool to set the first point at the centre and
the second point in the corner.
<LI>Press Ctrl-A to select the whole image and the press the 'Fill Selection'

<H4>3.5.6.5 Shapeburst Gradients</H4>
<P>
If you draw a filled ellipse, fill a rectangular or polygon area, or do a flood
fill in gradient mode without placing a gradient with the gradient placement
tool, you can create shapeburst gradients like this:

<H3>3.5.7 Blend</H3>
<P>
Blend mode can only be used on RGB images, and works by blending certain parts
of the source pixels with the canvas. In order to use this mode, you will need
to configure it by pressing the right mouse button on the mode button.
</P>
<P>
In this example I have painted 2 ellipses onto a greyscale background. The
ellipse on the left was painted using a pure red (RGB 255,0,0) with a 'Colour'
blend affecting red green and blue. The ellipse on the right was created using
a pure red again, with a 'Normal' blend affecting red and blue.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The blend in the blend mode icon can be achieved in 3 steps:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Paint a red circle using a normal blend affecting only the red channel.
<LI>Paint a green circle using a normal blend affecting only the green channel.
<LI>Paint a blue circle using a normal blend affecting only the blue channel.
</UL>

<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/3.5.7b.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
Using blend mode, you can reproduce the effects of GIMP's "layer modes"; choose
the blend named like the layer mode you want, and paste what would have been
the upper layer onto what would have been the lower one. In case of both layers
being the same image (as is most common), just copy the image and paste it
over itself.
</P>
<P>
mtPaint has no "Overlay" blend, because it does the same thing as "Soft Light";
when you need "Overlay", use "Soft Light" instead.
