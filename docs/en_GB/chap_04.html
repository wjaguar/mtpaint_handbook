<H1>4. The Selection Tool</H1>

<P>
The selection tool is used to mark out areas on the canvas. Once these areas
have been defined then you can do various operations such as filling, drawing an
outline or copying and pasting. These operations can be accessed via the
Selection menu or on the tools toolbar. The Edit menu has the cut and paste
options.
</P>
<P>
Unlike most other painting programs mtPaint does not have "selections", instead
it uses a selection channel which allows you to specify which pixels will be
copied. For example if you want an elliptical selection, you draw the ellipse in
the selection channel, then select and copy a rectangle, or polygon, around it.
If you want a selection that is a union of some shapes, you draw all the shapes
in the selection channel; if you want to unselect some part, you erase it in the
selection channel (draw with value 0). See <A HREF="chap_07.html">the channels chapter</A>
for more information and examples of how this works.
</P>
<P>
Paste function in mtPaint works in a somewhat unusual way; you position the
paste area over the canvas and commit the paste by right clicking or by pressing
Enter - and you can do so repeatedly until you dismiss the paste by pressing
Escape. Selecting another tool dismisses paste, but does not commit it unless
that is enabled in the Interface section of the Preferences window.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC1">4.1 Rectangle Selections</H2>

<P>
The rectangle selection works by clicking on the canvas and dragging from one
corner to another. After you have made a selection, clicking again anywhere on
the canvas will move the selection's nearest corner to the cursor position, and
you may then drag to place it more precisely. With the tool mouse cursor option
switched on you will see the relevant corner arrow to indicate this new
behaviour. This way, a new selection can be made with no dragging, just by
clicking two opposite corners of an area.
</P>
<P>
To drag only one side of the rectangle, not a corner, you hold Shift to keep the
width unchanged, or Ctrl+Shift to keep the height.
</P>
<P>
If you want to select the whole image press Ctrl-A. To clear this selection
press Escape, the right mouse button, Ctrl+Shift-A or use the Selection menu. The
selection box can be moved around pixel by pixel by using the arrow keys.
Pressing Shift and the arrow keys causes the selection box to be moved a set
number of pixels determined by the Preferences window. Pressing Ctrl and the
arrow keys moves one side of the box, changing its heiht or width pixel by pixel;
with Ctrl+Shift, the side is moved a set number of pixels at once.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC2">4.2 Polygon Selections</H2>

<P>
After selecting this tool you click the left mouse button on the canvas where
you want to start forming the polygon shape. You can then either hold the left
button down for a freehand shape or release it to have a long straight edge. To
finish press the right button. You can also create an polygon by holding down
the right mouse button and then dragging. In this case, releasing the right
button completes the polygon. To cancel the shape press the Escape key.
</P>
<P>
While creating the polygon, you can delete the current vertex with Ctrl+right
click. After the polygon is completed, a Ctrl+right click will remove the vertex
nearest to the cursor position.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC3">4.3 The Lasso</H2>

<P>
Once a selection has been made you can use the lasso tool to shrink wrap the
edges of the selection with the same colour. This feature works by flood filling
transparent pixels, starting at the first point of the polygon selection or the
top left of the rectangular selection. For example:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Select a rough area around a shape:
</UL>

<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/4.3a.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Press the lasso icon:
</UL>

<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/4.3b.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Paste the shape over a new background:
</UL>

<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/4.3c.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
Using the Selection menu you can also 'lasso cut' an area which fills the lasso
selected area on the canvas.
</P>
<P>
If you have made no selection on the canvas, the lasso tool will shrink wrap the
current clipboard (starting at the top left, as with a rectangular selection).
</P>
<P>
If you want the lasso tool to ignore the colours, and just shrink wrap the
selection shape defined by the selection channel, then right click on the lasso
tool icon and check the option 'By selection channel'.
</P>

<H3 ID="SEC31">4.3.1 Smoothing a Selection</H3>

<P>
If you want a smoother transition around a selection instead of a sharp boundary,
you can feather its edges, similar to the example in section
<A HREF="chap_07.html#SEC510">7.5.10</A>.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Switch to selection channel
<LI>Fill the selection
<LI>Use the Gaussian Blur effect on it, say with a value of 10
<LI>Switch to image channel
<LI>Select a rough area (rectangle or polygon) around the blurred selection shape
<LI>Right click on the lasso tool icon and check the option 'By selection channel'
<LI>Use the lasso tool
</UL>

<H2 ID="SEC4">4.4 Masking Colours</H2>

<P>
While you are pasting it is possible to make certain colours in the paste
invisible. For example:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Pasting a solid shape:
</UL>

<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/4.4a.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Select white as colour A and yellow as colour B, and select Selection-&gt;Mask
Colour A,B. This will make those coloured areas transparent:
</UL>

<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/4.4b.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
You can do this with as many colours as you want, just keep repeating the
procedure. Selecting Selection-&gt;Clear Mask will remove the mask entirely.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC5">4.5 Alpha Blending</H2>

<P>
Normal copying and pasting involves copying whole pixels from one area to
another. However, it is possible to use an alpha channel to blend certain areas
more smoothly. For example, here is a flat RGB image that has been exported from
Inkscape that contains several smooth edges and colour blends:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/4.5a.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
If I were to lasso the objects and paste them over a red background, it would 
look like this:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/4.5b.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
As you can see the edges of the objects look odd, and the blends look out of
place. There is a function in mtPaint that allows you to extract the blending
properties of a paste and put them over any background while keeping the
smoothness. As an example, use the first image above as a start point and then:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Select the black shapes with a rectangle selection box, copy and paste with
Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V.
<LI>Select black as colour A and white as colour B from the palette. 
<LI>Choose the menu option "Selection-&gt;Alpha blend A,B". 
<LI>Drag the paste box over the red area and commit the paste by pressing ENTER. 
</UL>

<P>
You should then see: 
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/4.5c.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Clear the paste box with the Escape key. Select, copy and paste the yellow
shapes with the same procedure above, but choose yellow as colour A. 
<LI>If you commit this second paste over the first you should end up with
something like this: 
</UL>

<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/4.5d.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
This technique works on any simple blend from one foreground colour to a
background colour. It works well with antialiasing as found around text and
geometric shapes created with programs like Inkscape which are exported to a
lossless format like PNG. Note that you must export a PNG image from Inkscape
with a flat colour background, not a transparent background.
</P>

<H3 ID="SEC51">4.5.1 Single Colour Variation</H3>

<P>
If you have colour A and B as the same colour you can turn that colour to alpha
in the selection and blend all other colours to shades of alpha. For example, if
you take the above image as an example, copy the top section, set colour A and B
as pure white and then paste the result after applying "Selection-&gt;Alpha blend
A,B" you will get the following result:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/4.5.1.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
This method works well when the source has a single colour background, with
several foreground colours of a totally different colour type.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC6">4.6 Multiple Clipboards</H2>

<P>
mtPaint allows the user to store up to 12 images in a multiple image clipboard.
This works by saving a PNG file containing the clipboard image and then using
the Edit menu to load these images as required.
</P>
<P>
The feature also means that you can have two independent mtPaint programs
running and be able to load and save clipboard data between the two at the touch
of a button. Also, as long as the files are not deleted you will have access to
these clipboard images after closing and restarting mtPaint, or even rebooting
the system.
</P>
<P>
It is possible to paste an RGB clipboard onto an RGB image and an Indexed
Palette clipboard onto an Indexed Palette or RGB image. As the clipboard files
are standard PNG files, the user can also open them in another mtPaint process
and edit them. The clipboard files are stored in the location set in the
Preferences window.
</P>
<P>
mtPaint uses its own internal clipboard which other programs cannot touch
without permission. In the Edit menu, you can use the "Import clipboard from
system" command to copy clipboard contents from some other program into
mtPaint, or "Export clipboard to system" to let other programs paste the
contents of mtPaint's clipboard. In case mtPaint cannot import the clipboard, an
error message will be displayed; if you see no error but a paste area did not
appear either, it means the imported clipboard is RGB while the current image is
Indexed Palette, and cannot be pasted.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC7">4.7 Brush Pasting</H2>

<P>
While you are pasting, you can hold both the left and right mouse buttons at the
same time to achieve a brush pasting effect. If you are pasting an object with a
non rectangular edge you can achieve some interesting effects like this:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/4.7a.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
Here I have pasted a semi transparent orb with the opacity mode switched off.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC8">4.8 Ramps</H2>

<P>
Using the the rectangle selection tool and the selection menu ramp options you
can create a vertical or horizontal ramp between 2 points or lines on the
canvas. In this zoomed example I have created a ramp between a red and yellow
line to create a perfectly smooth gradient:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/4.8.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
What the options do, is take the leftmost and the rightmost colours of each row
(horizontal ramp), or the topmost and the bottommost ones of every column
(vertical ramp) inside the selection area, and fill the row/column with an RGB
transition between the two. If "Use gamma correction when painting" setting is
enabled, the transition will be linear RGB (sRGB).
</P>
<P>
As well as canvas effects the ramp can also be combined with the palette copying
featuring in section <A HREF="chap_03.html#SEC37">3.3.7</A> to create perfectly spaced one or
two dimensional palettes.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC9">4.9 Paste Swap</H2>

<P>
When editing an image containing many fixed sized tiles its nice to swap 2 areas
of the canvas with a minimum of effort. To do this you can use the paste swap:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Select the first area with the rectangle selection tool.
<LI>Press Ctrl+C or Ctrl+X to copy or cut the original area.
<LI>Move the paste area to where you want to swap.
<LI>Press Shift+Enter to commit the swap.
<LI>Move the new paste area back to the original copy/cut place and commit the
paste.
</UL>

<P>
You can repeat these steps many times to switch many tiles in sequence. In some
situations where there are no guidelines on the canvas, cutting the original
area is more useful as it leaves a hole which you can aim for later when pasting
the final item.
</P>
