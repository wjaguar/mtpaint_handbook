<H1>10. Scripting</H1>

<P>
mtPaint is totally scriptable. Everything you can do (except tweaking the GUI) you
can also do from a script.
</P>
<P>
You can run scripts in one of four ways.
</P>
<P>
First is direct execution. Select 'Image-&gt;Scripts-&gt;Configure' menu option, choose
a free script slot in the list on top, enter the commands in the window below,
press "Execute", and it will happen. If there is an error in your script,
execution will stop on it and the problem will be reported.
</P>
<P>
Second is the 'Image-&gt;Scripts' submenu. If in the example above you fill the
"Action" entry, above the commands window, with something not totally commented
out (first non-whitespace character not "<B>#</B>", that is), enter the commands and
press "OK", the action will appear in said submenu. Note that menu slots are
rigidly mapped to the script list's rows; only the first 10 rows can appear in
the menu, and whether a row's action is commented out or empty, its menu slot
still belongs to it.
</P>
<P>
Third is an extension of the second; in 'Help-&gt;Keyboard Shortcuts...' you assign
a key to 'Image-&gt;Scripts-&gt;1'...'10', and then use that key to run your script that
is sitting in the submenu.
</P>
<P>
And last but certainly not least, you can use the commandline mode. If the first
option on the commandline is "<B>--cmd</B>", everything else after it is treated as
script commands, and the GUI is not fired up at all. Any changes done to
persistent settings and preferences while in commandline mode, are not written
back into the inifile either.
</P>
<P>
Note that when a script is executing, all confirmation requests are automatically
answered in the positive, or not asked at all. You will have no chance to change
your mind at the last moment; it is assumed that you did your thinking <I>before</I>
activating the script.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC1">10.1 Script Commands</H2>

<P>
The commands are every bit as stable as menu structure and dialog items' naming
is. Because the "commands" are the very same names - or, any prefix of any word in
them that does still match uniquely. This self-naming and self-documenting is
part of the reason why scripting is implemented through the V-code.
</P>
<P>
A script is commands with their parameters. Commands are prefixed with "<B>-</B>"
and match to menu items; parameters are followed by "<B>=</B>" and a value, and match
to dialog items. If a command itself is followed by "<B>=</B>" and value, that
matches the unnamed item in the dialog. But such an unnamed option can just stand
alone: "<B>-file/as=zad</B>" is fully equivalent to "<B>-file/as =zad</B>".
</P>
<P>
The entire name of a menu option, including spaces, is the canonical name of its
matching command - with shell quoting used to protect the spaces. Like this:
</P>
<P>
<B>mtpaint --cmd -file/'save as ...'=zad</B>
</P>
<P>
It is safe to shorten the "<B>save as ...</B>" to just "<B>as</B>", because no word in
other items' names in the same submenu starts with "as". And so it is done in the
examples. But "save" on its own is a match for another item in the same submenu:
"File-&gt;Save", which stands before "File-&gt;Save as".
</P>
<P>
Parts separated by "<B>/</B>" are matched to corresponding menu levels in order. So
to call up "Effects-&gt;Isometric transformation-&gt;Top side right", you can write a
command "<B>-eff/iso/top</B>". Or more verbosely, "<B>-effect/isometric/top</B>".
</P>
<P>
Same thing about parameters. You can write:
</P>
<P>
<B>mtpaint --cmd -file/'save as' =zad 'file format'=png 'transparency index'=0 'png compression'=9</B>
</P>
<P>
But it is just as unambiguous in this case to write this instead:
</P>
<P>
<B>mtpaint --cmd -file/as=zad f=png t=0 p=9</B>
</P>
<P>
Still, for the sake of understandability it's better to use some more chars per
option. Say, like this:
</P>
<P>
<B>mtpaint --cmd -file/as=zad format=png trans=0 png=9</B>
</P>
<P>
But it is not unambiguous to use "c=9", "comp=9" or even "compression=9", because
there also exist "JPEG2000 compression" and "TGA RLE compression" in this same
dialog (visible to user for different filetypes, but V-code sees them all at once).
</P>
<P>
So "<B>-effect/unsharp r=1 am=0.4</B>" in the example means the same as
"<B>-effects/'unsharp mask' radius=1 amount=0.4</B>" would.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed parameter matches to the unnamed control in a dialog - usually it is
the top one, but not always. For fileselector, it is filename; for most filters,
it is value spinbutton; but for image scale, you can see it is filter name -
everything above their list has names; for image resize - tiling mode, for the
same reason. So you see "<B>-image/scale=nearest</B>" and "<B>-image/resize=mirror</B>"
in the examples.
</P>
<P>
To select options from lists, such as filter names or file formats, values are
matched to option names just the same way as parameters are matched to dialog
items, and commands to menu items. So "<B>image/scale=near</B>" will select you the
"Nearest neighbour" scaling method.
</P>
<P>
In a list with named columns, each name refers to a list of that column's values;
like in "<B>-edit/freetype font=Arial filename=arial.ttf face=0</B>".
</P>
<P>
The matching rule for string values:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>matching is case-insensitive according to current locale
<LI>initial match is preferred
<LI>shorter value with initial match is preferred to longer
<LI>the first value with a middle match goes if no initial match found
<LI>a middle match is by trying every word in the value after the first, as per
  "find a space, skip all spaces and opening parentheses, try here": in "Paste
  Text (FreeType)", try "Text (FreeType)" and then "FreeType)"
</UL>

<P>
To check a checkbutton or toggle a togglebutton on, you assign to it some true
value, or omit the assignment and just mention the name. Same thing to press a
button (if it is scriptable). Like this: "<B>-image/resize w=x2 fix centre</B>".
Unchecking or toggling off always requires an explicit assignment of a false
value. The check menuitems work the same way; "<B>-channels/couple</B>" enables
the 'Couple RGBA Operations', "<B>-channels/couple=0</B>" disables it.
</P>
<P>
If you aren't sure whether a parameter would be present in the dialog at all (it
is one such as might get disabled) but want to set it in case it's present, you
prefix its name with "<B>.</B>" Say, to scale an image of unknown type in a nearest
neighbor mode, it's safe to write "<B>-image/scale .=near</B>", but
"<B>-image/scale=near</B>" will fail to match in case the image turns out to be a GIF
or other indexed format.
</P>
<P>
Note that parameters that are merely conditionally hidden, stay readily accessible
from a script despite that; for example, you can set PNG compression level for the
file you're about to save, even before selecting the PNG format:
"<B>-file/as=zad png=9 form=png</B>". The same rule applies to content of 'Settings'
pages of dialogs such as 'Convert to Indexed' and 'Scale Canvas'.
</P>
<P>
For ease of use, the "Width" and "Height" fields in "Scale canvas" and "Resize
canvas" dialogs are made to understand a couple formats that a regular spinbutton
wouldn't. Like this:
</P>

<DL>
<DT>"<B>w=x1.5</B>" - multiplies the original value by 1.5;</DT><DD>
<DT>"<B>w=33%</B>" - 33% of the original value.</DT><DD>
</DL>

<P>
If "Fix aspect ratio" is toggled on ("<B>fix=1</B>" if you aren't sure it is) then
setting the width will correspondingly modify the height, or vice versa. But only
the first time; so you can write "w=200% h=x1" to make the image twice wider, and
not bother with "Fix aspect ratio" setting.
</P>
<P>
This is how it works.
</P>

<H3 ID="SEC11">10.1.1 Groups</H3>

<P>
There are places where items with same or similar names sit in one dialog. They
are disambiguated with named groups (in V-code, it is the <I>GROUPN</I> command).
Similarly to menu path in a command, parts of a parameter name separated by
"<B>/</B>" are matched first to groups, and then to items in a group. Like this:
</P>
<P>
<B>-image/skew horizontal/offset=10 vertical/offset=20</B>
</P>
<P>
See <A HREF="#SEC5">section 10.5</A> for full list of those places and the group names.
</P>

<H3 ID="SEC12">10.1.2 Flattening</H3>

<P>
An option menu or a radiobutton pack can be made to present its list of choices
to scripts as if they are separate dialog items (in V-code, it is the <I>FLATTEN</I>
command). For example, you can do "<B>-edit/paste left</B>" instead of wordier
"<B>-edit/paste align=left</B>".
</P>
<P>
The places where that is done, are listed in <A HREF="#SEC5">section 10.5</A>.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC2">10.2 Quoting and Comments</H2>

<P>
Quoting and word-splitting in scripts works the same as in Bourne shell. Words
(i.e. commands) are split on unquoted whitespace. For quoting, you can use double
quotes, single quotes, and backslashes.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Inside double quotes, you can use a backslash to quote another backslash, a
doublequote, a backtick, a dollar sign, or an end of line; a backslash before
anything else is not special and is taken literally.
<LI>Inside single quotes, everything is taken literally.
<LI>Anything preceded by a backslash is taken literally, except end of line which is
  then just ignored (and the next line is taken as continuation).
</UL>

<P>
A comment in a script is everything from an unquoted "<B>#</B>" to the end of line
(again, same as in Bourne shell).
</P>

<PRE>
  # This is an example
  -e/freetype text="One \"Example text\" "\ 'in
  two lines' # now is on clipboard
  -e\
  /paste=(100,100) # now is on canvas
</PRE>

<H2 ID="SEC3">10.3 Lists</H2>

<P>
Some dialogs, for ease of use, have controls (usually their unnamed one) accepting
lists of values. (On V-code level, it is the <I>EVENT(MULTI, handler)</I> command.)
</P>
<P>
A list is one or more whitespace-separated groups of comma-separated values, put
in parentheses. When assigning to the unnamed control, the "<B>=</B>" is optional.
Like in the example below:
</P>
<P>
<B>-select/all (11,22 95,55 11,166) # Select a triangle</B>
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC4">10.4 Toolbars</H2>

<P>
Tools toolbar, settings toolbar, and layers toolbar and window are accessed
through the Edit menu: "<B>-edit/tools</B>", "<B>-edit/settings</B>",
"<B>-edit/layers</B>".
</P>
<P>
In place of a right click on a button, to open its configuration dialog, you add
"<B>:</B>" to its name; a freestanding "<B>:</B>" closes the dialog and returns you to
the toolbar. Like this: "<B>-edit/settings blend: =value : blend</B>" first
configures the blend mode to the Value blend, and then enables it.
</P>
<P>
To use a drawing tool, you enable it and then assign its path as a list, to the
toolbar's unnamed control:
</P>
<P>
<B>-edit/tool paint (10,10 20,10 20,20 30,20)</B>
</P>
<P>
If you want to simulate a pressure-enabled tool, such as a tablet, add a third
value (between 0 and 1) for pressure:
</P>
<P>
<B>-edit/tool paint (10,10,0.5 20,10,0.7 20,20,0.8 30,20,1)</B>
</P>
<P>
Without that third value pressure is set to <B>1</B>, same as when you use a mouse.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC5">10.5 Irregularities</H2>

<P>
While for the most part, mtPaint's scripting capabilities are self-documenting,
there also exists the other part.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Some menu items are not made visible to scripts, and conversely, there exist
  some invisible ones added purely for scripting.
<LI>Some dialogs have extra aliases for some of the controls, or even a fully
  invisible script-only control or two.
<LI>Some menu items, when activated from a script, even "open" an entire invisible,
  script-only dialog with several such controls.
<LI>Some dialogs have controls that take lists, or spinbuttons that understand
  multipliers and percentages.
<LI>Some dialogs have their unnamed control different from their first one.
<LI>Some things do not work, or work differently, in commandline mode.
</UL>

<P>
While all of that can be found out from reading the code, the sections below list
such invisible features for each location in the interface that has them.
</P>

<H3 ID="SEC51">10.5.1 The File Menu</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>New</B>
  <UL>
  <LI>The unnamed control is the image type radiobutton pack: "24 bit RGB", ...
  <LI>In commandline mode, the "Grab Screenshot" option is not present.
  </UL>
<LI><B>Open ...</B>
  <UL>
  <LI>Script-only controls for loading multipage/multiframe files (TIFF, GIF etc.):
    <UL>
    <LI>"Load into Layers" (checkbox)
    <LI>"Explode Frames" (path entry for the destination directory)
    <LI>"Frames" (option menu: "Raw frames", "Composited frames", "Composited frames
      with nonzero delay", as in the "Load Frames" dialog)
    <LI>"File Format" (option menu, as in the "Choose frames directory" window)
    </UL>

</UL>

<P>
File actions and recent files are invisible to scripts.
</P>

<H3 ID="SEC52">10.5.2 The Edit Menu</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>Undo</B> and <B>Redo</B>
  <UL>
  <LI>Script-only control:
    <UL>
    <LI>unnamed (spinbutton for repeat count)
    </UL>
  </UL>
<LI><B>Paste</B> and <B>Paste To Centre</B>
  <UL>
  <LI>When those are called from script, the paste automatically gets committed.
  <LI>Script-only controls for where and how to commit:
    <UL>
    <LI>"Align"/unnamed (flattened option menu: "Left", "Right", "Top", "Bottom",
      "Centre")
    <LI>"swap" (checkbutton, for <A HREF="chap_04.html#SEC9">paste swap</A>)
    <LI>"x0" (spinbutton)
    <LI>"y0" (spinbutton)
    </UL>
  <LI>The "flattened option menu" above presents its choices also as controls, so
    you can do "<B>-e/paste left top</B>" instead of wordier
    "<B>-e/paste align=left align=top</B>". Each align choice is applied immediately,
    so "<B>-e/paste centre left</B>" centers the image in vertical direction and
    left-aligns in the horizontal.
  <LI>The unnamed control accepts list with coordinates where to paste; there can
    be more than one location, for <A HREF="chap_04.html#SEC7">brush pasting</A>:
    "<B>-e/paste (5,5 10,10 20,10)</B>". You can add a third value for pressure
    (fractional between 0 and 1): "<B>-e/paste (5,5,0.5 10,10,0.75 20,10,1)</B>".
  </UL>
<LI><B>Paste Text</B> and <B>Paste Text (FreeType)</B>
  <UL>
  <LI>The "Background colour =" name means the spinbutton, no checkbutton there in
    script mode; use the value <B>-1</B> for no background.
  <LI>Same thing with "DPI ="; use <B>0</B> for the default value.
  <LI>Same thing with "Angle of rotation ="; use <B>0</B> for no rotation.
  </UL>

  <UL>
  <LI>Needs GUI to work, is invisible to scripts in commandline mode.
  <LI>Font selector has the name "Font".
  <LI>Script-only control "Text" (entry).
  </UL>
<LI><B>Paste Text (FreeType)</B>
  <UL>
  <LI>The unnamed control is the list of font names, also named "Font" per its named
    column.
  <LI>The font names seen from scripts are prefixed with "B " for bitmap and "S "
    for scalable: use "<B>-e/freetype font="S Courier"</B>" to avoid matching bitmap
    Courier fonts, for example. Also to disambiguate simple font names; "Arial"
    would match "S Arial Black" if it is encountered first (and note that the list
    seen from script isn't sorted), while "S Arial" prefers the shortest matching
    value (due to being an initial match instead of a middle one).
  <LI>The "Size" name means the spinbutton under the sizes list, and serves for
    scalable fonts; the list itself has the name "Bitmap size" and serves for
    bitmap ones.
  <LI>The "Font Directories" tab and everything in it is invisible to scripts.
  </UL>
<LI><B>Choose Pattern ...</B>
  <UL>

    <LI>"X" (spinbutton for A pattern's column)
    <LI>"Y" (spinbutton for A pattern's row)
    </UL>
  <LI>The "A"/unnamed and "B" also accept lists of pattern's column/row:
    "<B>-e/pattern=(3,3) b=(0,3)</B>"
  <LI>The negative pattern indices, from <B>-1</B> to <B>-16</B>, correspond to the 4x4
    Bayer patterns, from the 15/16 to 0/16 filled respectively.
