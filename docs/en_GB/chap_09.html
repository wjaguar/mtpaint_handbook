<H1>9. Animation</H1>

<P>
mtPaint is able to edit frames of animations and also generate animation frames
with the layer facilities. If you have the program Gifsicle installed you can
also create an animated GIF file. If you don't have Gifsicle already you can
download it <A HREF="http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/">HERE</A>.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC1">9.1 Loading Animated GIF Files</H2>

<P>
When you attempt to load a GIF file that has several frames, mtPaint will load
the first frame, detect there are more and then give you a message to ask what
you want to do with the file. You can either leave it at that, or load up to the
first 100 animation frames into layers, or export ("explode") all the frames
into a directory to edit them as separate files, or view the animation in
Gifsicle's <B>gifview</B>.
</P>
<P>
Frames can be loaded, or exported, in one of 3 ways:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Composited frames</B> (the default) means animation frames as they are
displayed.
<LI><B>Raw frames</B> means frames as they are stored in the original file.
<LI><B>Composited frames with nonzero delay</B> means only those animation frames
that have a chance to be seen: some GIF files composite several frames without
any delay to produce one visible frame. This isn't the default because some
(ancient) GIFs use a zero delay throughout while still containing animations.
</UL>

<P>
If you do "Explode frames", then mtPaint will prompt you for a temporary
directory to store these frames in. It is advisable to create a new folder (via
the file selector) near the original GIF file for easy navigation.
</P>
<P>
After mtPaint has created these frames, a new mtPaint process will be started
with the frame filenames in the command line window. You click on a frame
filename and this will be loaded so you can edit it as a normal image.
</P>
<P>
Once you have finished editing the frames and you want to create the new
animation file, select 'Export GIF animation' from the file menu to bring up the
file dialog. The frame delay box sets the delay in 1/100ths of a second between
each of the frames. This value should be remembered from when the animation was
loaded, but it may not be accurate if the input file has several different delay
values. In the filename box enter the new filename e.g. 'new.gif' and then save
the file to your preferred location.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC2">9.2 Creating Animated GIF Files</H2>

<P>
Here is an example of the steps you might take to create a simple animated GIF
file:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Use the File menu to create a new indexed palette image of 320x240 pixels with
8 colours. To create an animated GIF it must be indexed palette, not RGB.
<LI>Use the File menu to select 'Save as'. Navigate to a suitable place and create
a new folder for your animation images. Enter this folder, select the GIF
format, and name the file 'frame-001.gif'.
<P></P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/9.2a.gif" ALT="">
<P></P>
<LI>Press T to bring up the text paste input window and type 'Animating'. Press
Enter and paste this text at the top of the image. Use 'File-&gt;Save as' to save
this image as 'frame-002.gif'.
<P></P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/9.2b.gif" ALT="">
<P></P>
<LI>Press T again and paste the text 'is' to the centre of the image. Save this
image as 'frame-003.gif'.
<P></P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/9.2c.gif" ALT="">
<P></P>
<LI>Press T again and paste the text 'fun' to the bottom of the image. Save this
image as 'frame-004.gif'.
<P></P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/9.2d.gif" ALT="">
<P></P>
<LI>Select 'Export animated GIF' from the file menu to bring up the file dialog.
Enter 100 in the frame delay box which creates a delay of 1 second between each
of the frames. In the filename box enter 'final.gif' and then press enter to
create the file.
<P></P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/9.2e.gif" ALT="">
</UL>

<H2 ID="SEC3">9.3 Animating Layers</H2>

<P>
Using layers to create an animation can save a lot of time and effort. Instead
of editing each frame pixel by pixel you set up key frames defining the
positions of all the layers. Once you are happy with the setup you can create
all of the frames at the touch of a button as mtPaint will calculate all of the
'in between' frames. You will need to be very comfortable using layers, so if
you aren't I would suggest you read the section on layers.
</P>

<H3 ID="SEC31">9.3.1 Preparation of Ideas</H3>

<P>
Once you have come up with an idea for an animation you need to prepare your
plans before using mtPaint. For example you need to decide on issues like final
image size, frames per second, number of colours used and total animation
duration.
</P>

<H3 ID="SEC32">9.3.2 Project Initializing</H3>

<P>
Before starting work on the animation it is advisable to create a new directory
to put all of the image files in as this makes file management much easier. You
then create a background image which will set the size of the final animation.
Finally you create and save each of the image layers that you want in the
animation.
</P>
<P>
Once the image layers are in place you can then configure the animation with the
menu option 'Frames-&gt;Configure Animation'. Here you determine the first and last
frame numbers, the name of the directory to hold the frames, and various other
details.
</P>

<H3 ID="SEC33">9.3.3 Setting up Positions and Cycle Data</H3>

<P>
After you have positioned each of the layers for the first frame, you select the
menu option 'Frames-&gt;Set key frame'. You can then do this for further key frames
in the animation. In the positions tab of the configuration window, you could
have the following 2 lines:
</P>
<P>
1 10 10 255 0
</P>
<P>
10 20 20 128 0
</P>
<P>
This layer will begin at position (10,10) in frame 1 and move to (20,20) at
frame 10 with opacity changing from 100% (255) to 50% (128). Each of the frames
2-9 are calculated by mtPaint as in between frames. The 0 at the end means this
will be a straight line. A value of 1 would mean mtPaint moves this layer on a
slightly smoother curve between the given points.
</P>
<P>
The cycles tab is used to determine which layers are visible at any particular
time. Up to 100 lines can be entered in the following format:
</P>
<P>
frame1 frame2 layer1, layer2, layer3, ... , layer50
</P>
<P>
Up to 100 layers can be listed on each line. Between the 2 frames of the
animation only one of the sequence will be visible, with the others being
switched off. As the frame increments, the next layer in the sequence will be
shown, and the previous one hidden.
</P>
<P>
For example:
</P>
<P>
1 10 1, 2, 3
</P>
<P>
Will cycle the visibility of layers 1, 2, 3 between frames 1 and 10.
</P>
<P>
The background layer (layer 0) is never hidden; you can use it as a placeholder,
on the steps when none of the layers in the sequence should be visible. And when
several layers at once should be shown on a single step, you list them in
parentheses.
</P>
<P>
For example:
</P>
<P>
1 16 0, (2, 3, 4)
</P>
<P>
Will alternately turn layers 2, 3 and 4 off and on - all three of them at once -
between frames 1 and 16.
</P>
<P>
Normally frame2 will be greater than frame1, but if they are equal you can then
manually set which layers are visible or invisible at that frame. For example:
</P>
<P>
15 15 10, 11, 12, -1, -2, -3
</P>
<P>
Will show layers 10, 11, 12 and hide layers 1, 2, 3 at frame 15.
</P>
<P>
You can then preview this animation by pressing the preview button (or by using
the Frames menu) and dragging the slider to view the animation. You can also use
the arrow keys, page up/down keys, or + or - keys to change frames.
</P>

<H3 ID="SEC34">9.3.4 Exporting Frames for GIF, WebP, or MPEG Encoding</H3>

<P>
When you are happy with the animation you have created you can export the frames
with the 'Create Frames' button. The file format you choose determines the type
of images that will be generated; if it supports RGB, mtPaint will output RGB
frames, if not, indexed (using Wu quantization to reduce the number of colours if
needed). If the format supports alpha and your animation has transparent
background, frames will have alpha transparency. See section <A HREF="chap_A.html#SEC2">A.2</A>
for information on which format supports what. The compression options (if any)
for the format need be chosen in the Preferences window beforehand.
</P>
<P>
If you have selected the GIF format, mtPaint will generate indexed palette GIF
files, but you can choose PNG and it will generate RGB or RGBA PNG files. You can
then use encoding software such as Gifsicle, img2webp, ffmpeg, or mencoder to turn
these frames into an animation file. If encoding to GIF files, mtPaint will
attempt to call Gifsicle automatically and create the animated GIF for you. On
GNU/Linux systems gifview will also be used to display the result.
</P>
<P>
Here is an example of how to get mencoder to create an MPEG file with RGB PNG
files:
</P>
<P>
<B>mencoder mf://*.png -mf fps=25 -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4 -o output.avi</B>
</P>
<P>
Here is how to get ffmpeg do a similar thing:
</P>
<P>
<B>ffmpeg -r 25 -f image2 -pattern_type glob -i '*.png' -vcodec libx264 output.mp4</B>
</P>
<P>
Here, how to create an animated WebP file with img2webp:
</P>
<P>
<B>img2webp -v -o output.webp -lossy -q 90 -d 40 *.png</B>
</P>

</P>

<H3 ID="SEC35">9.3.5 Extra Notes</H3>

<P>
If you are composing a particularly long animation that needs more than 100
lines in the position or cycle table you can simply copy the layers file and
have different files for each section of the animation. For example
'layers00001-00500.txt' could be for the first 500 frames and
'layers00500-01000.txt' could be for the second 500 frames. You then create the
frames as normal in each case and knit them together with your favourite encoder
software.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC4">9.4 Indexed Palette Animation Examples</H2>

<P>
Here are some examples of animations created with mtPaint and Gifsicle. Click on
each image to download the source files:

</P>

<H2 ID="SEC5">9.5 RGB Animation Examples</H2>

<P>
Although mtPaint is mainly geared towards indexed palette pixel art, it is also
capable of creating RGB animations which use a larger canvas, a higher frame
rate, and with variable opacity for the layers. Here are some examples:
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="../files/9.5b.zip"><IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/9.5b.png" ALT=""></A>
</P>
<P>
When creating the frames for this animation you are advised to use a low value
for PNG compression, in the range of 1 to 5. See section <A HREF="chap_A.html#SEC21">A.2.1</A>
for more information on PNG compression settings.
</P>

<H2 ID="SEC6">9.6 Palette Shifting</H2>

<P>
Palette shifting is an old technique used to create the illusion of movement by
shifting palette colours between set limits. Because it is palette based, it
only works on indexed palette images. The palette shifter in mtPaint is invoked
by using the Palette menu option, which will show you the following dialog:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/9.6a.png" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
Each row represents a palette shift in the sequence with the first two numbers
representing the first and last numbers of the palette colours to be shifted. By
reversing the numbers you will reverse the direction of the shifting. The delay
is the number of frames to wait before the next shift, with zero meaning no
delay.
</P>
<P>
Here are two images:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="../img/9.6b.png" ALT=""> <IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/9.6c.gif" ALT=""> 
</P>
<P>
If you load the first image into mtPaint, and then call up the palette shifter
dialog you can reproduce the animation by entered the following data:
</P>
<P>
13,6,0
</P>
<P>
50,19,0
</P>
<P>
51,82,0
</P>
<P>
In order to make it clearer how I created the image, here is a version of the
image with a slightly different palette to expose the hidden colours:
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/9.6d.png" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
Once you have created an animation you are happy with, you can create an
animated GIF using the following steps:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Load the original image, in order to clear the undo history.
<LI>Set up the palette shifter with the values you want, and using the play button
to preview the results.
<LI>Press the 'Create Frames' button and close the palette shifter window.
<LI>Undo one frame by pressing Ctrl-Z.
<LI>Select 'Export Undo Images' from the File menu and place the files in a new
directory somehwere using the filename 'out'. Make sure you select the GIF file
type.
<LI>Load one of these undo frames such as out001.gif.
<LI>Select 'Export Animated GIF' from the File menu and choose a suitable filename
and delay.
</UL>

<P>
